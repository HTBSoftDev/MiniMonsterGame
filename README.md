🕹️ MiniMonsterGame
A small automatic battle game where two opponents fight each other until one is defeated.

How it works:

The game features two opponents who take turns attacking each other.

Each attack deals a random amount of damage, reducing the other player's HP.

The first player to reach 0 HP loses.

There is no user interaction – the battle runs automatically until the end.
